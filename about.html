    <p>Basically, I have a passion for learning and personal development. Web programming, animations, graphics, video
        editing are some topics I
        love to read about. This program at Humber College gives me a platform to learn about web development in depth, and I hope
        to build on the knowlegde from this program to help me become a good web developer.
